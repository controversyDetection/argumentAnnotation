You can't listen to everyone's bad experience until you've experienced it yourself. Took the first dose at 5pm and drank the 32oz of water within the hour after.  Started working within 30-40 min and continued for about an hour.

    I already feel cleaned out yet still have to take the next dose at 10pm followed by another 32oz of water within the hour.

  Hoping it works as fast as the first dose. Don't want to be up passed midnight.  Scheduled to be at surgery center for 8:30am!</div>
