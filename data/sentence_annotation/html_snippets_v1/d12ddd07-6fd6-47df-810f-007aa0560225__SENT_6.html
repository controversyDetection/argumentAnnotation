<div class="entities" style="line-height: 2.5; direction: ltr">I approached my psychiatrist who told me he'd never heard of this off-label use for Tramadol and he would not prescribe.  I went back to my former (beloved) psychiatrist who'd stopped accepting insurance (hence the change).  He was sympathetic, but said he couldn't prescribe it, risking his license.  He suggested my G.P.

    I was sure she'd say no, so I never asked until last Friday over the patient portal.

  I said I needed it for chronic hip and knee pain (not untruthful) and I was surprised she prescribed.  Now I am torn about visiting her and requesting more.  I am afraid she will not give more for the stated reason and really will not give more if I divulge the true reason.  I see my psychiatrist Monday and will seek his advice.</div>
