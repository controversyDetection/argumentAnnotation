<div class="entities" style="line-height: 2.5; direction: ltr">Got skyla inserted about a month ago a few days after my last period. The insertion was uncomfortable but not bad at all. Had severe cramps the first week after insertion but it was managed by ibuprofen. I've been spotting since inserted but had one week without. Started my period last week and it's just been light, almost like spotting (very very annoying).

 but I'm now going into day 8. Hoping the spotting stops soon so I can stop wearing pads. Good luck to all who try this!</div>
