<div class="entities" style="line-height: 2.5; direction: ltr">My prep instructions were one 6oz bottle the evening before and one 6oz bottle the morning of the colonoscopy. Both times were similar, started working within 20-25 minutes and lasted a couple hours. I mixed with Sprite. The review that mentions salty grape cough syrup was spot on.

    The first bottle wasn't terrible, the second one almost made me puke.

 Compared to other prep experiences I've heard outside of this site I think Suprep is probably one of the easier ones, of course everyone reacts different.</div>
