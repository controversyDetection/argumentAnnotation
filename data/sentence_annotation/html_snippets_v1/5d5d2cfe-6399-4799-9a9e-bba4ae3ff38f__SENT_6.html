<div class="entities" style="line-height: 2.5; direction: ltr">I'm on day 3 of this prescription. I'm still unsure of any side affects or effectiveness. I've taken adipex many different times, over the last 5 years. I could always &quot;feel&quot; when it was working. This definitely doesn't suppress any appetite for me, like the adipex did. As of now I don't understand what it does.

    I'm hoping as I increase the dosage, the medication will begin to help with the weight loss.

 I have noticed, however, that I am very tired after taking it. I'm also taking 25 mg of topamax in the morning, and 25 mg at night for headaches, as well as 20 mg of Prozac for anxiety. My doctor said they were all ok to take together, and that one wouldn't cancel out another. </br>I will update after a month on Contrave.</div>
