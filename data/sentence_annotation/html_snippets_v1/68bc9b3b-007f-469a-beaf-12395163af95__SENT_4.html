    The only downside is I have gained about 20 lbs.

 My lowest weight was 133, considered healthy for someone 5'7 and athletic, but despite my clean eating and exercise I've blown up to 163 lbs in 2 years and nothing seems to get the weight off. This has been my only negative side effect. I choose my mental health over my body image although I also have an eating disorder BDD.</div>
