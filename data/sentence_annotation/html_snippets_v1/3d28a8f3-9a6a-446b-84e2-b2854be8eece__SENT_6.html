<div class="entities" style="line-height: 2.5; direction: ltr">Started Nexplanon 2 months ago because I have a minimal amount of contraception's I can take due to my inability to take the hormone that is used in most birth controls. I'm trying to give it time because it is one of my only options right now. But honestly if I had options I'd get it removed.</br>I've never had acne problems in my life, and immediately broke out after getting it implanted. Sex drive is completely gone, and I used to have sex with my boyfriend a few days a week, now its completely forced and not even fun for me anymore. I mean I'm on birth control because I like having sex but don't want to get pregnant

    , why take a birth control that takes away sex?

 Very unhappy and hope that I get it back with time or I'm getting it removed.</div>
