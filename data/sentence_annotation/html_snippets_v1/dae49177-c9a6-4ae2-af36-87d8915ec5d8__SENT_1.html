    All my anxiety/depression symptoms started coming back gradually and I was put on various other drugs like Lyrica, Cymbalta, Lustral, etc and none of them worked and the side effects with some of them were cruel.

 I am now back on Lexapro, starting at 5mg and increasing by 5mg every week till I reach 20mg. This was the only drug that cured me before, I found it wonderful first time round so fingers crossed it will work again. The side effects starting off are not to bad. I know last time round I didn't gain weight so I hope I don't this time either. It's so good.</div>
