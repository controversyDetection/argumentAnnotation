<div class="entities" style="line-height: 2.5; direction: ltr">Started this last night. I have zero appetite. How is this possible? I love food, but I don't really feel like eating. All I've had today is some grapes. I have a sandwich in my lunchbox, but I don't have any appetite. I haven't had any of the side effects so far. I started with the 1.2 dose. The &quot;pen&quot; is really easy to use compared to my intramuscular testosterone. However, this drug is ridiculously expensive. Even with good insurance, I would have to pay almost $400 a MONTH!!!

    Fortunately, another serious illness pushed me over my out-of-pocket annual.

 So, I filled the script for $0. Due to politics I may have no insurance next year. Anyway, so far, so good with Victoza.</div>
