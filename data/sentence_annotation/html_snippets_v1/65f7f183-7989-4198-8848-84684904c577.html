    I first started birth control around 2004, age 22.

    I tried the Pill, and all it did was make me spot and have periods that lasted for weeks-
    <span style="font-size: 0.8em; font-weight: bold; line-height: 1; border-radius: 0.35em; vertical-align: middle; margin-left: 0.5rem">SENT3</span>

    so I stopped using it.

    Then I tried the NuvaRing- that worked for about 3 months then the spotting started again.

    I then had no birth control until August of 2010.

    I had been told when I first tried to get the IUD in 2004 that you can't have one unless you've had at least one child, so I gave up.

    It was either between Mirena or Paragard-since I have heavy menstrual cycles and cramps and PMS, I chose the Mirena.
