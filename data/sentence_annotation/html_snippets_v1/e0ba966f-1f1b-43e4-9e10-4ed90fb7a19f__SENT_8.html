<div class="entities" style="line-height: 2.5; direction: ltr">I absolutely love my Skyla. Insertion was pretty uncomfortable, but was completely bearable. I spotted on and off for the first few months, which was annoying, but not a deal breaker. Finally after about 6 months my periods have levelled out and are regular again. I get very minimal cramping a few days before, and a light flow that lasts about 6 days. I have had no other negative side effects and I LOVE not having to remember a pill every day! Plus, every other birth control I've tried has given me horrible moods swings, horribly tender breasts, and acne. I haven't experienced any of those with Skyla.

    I would highly recommend this and have already sung it praises to all my friends.
