<div class="entities" style="line-height: 2.5; direction: ltr">I was on OrthoTriCyclenLo for about 3 years. I had to switch off this pill because my insurance didn't cover it anymore and there was no way I'd be paying $109 per pack. I didn't have any bad side effects on this pill. I noticed I gained about 10lbs over the years on this pill, but I wouldn't 100% blame that on the pill, I'd say it's more to do with me not working out and stuffing my face. My boobs grew 3 cup sizes.

    I was a 36C before, then worked my way up to a 32DDD.

 My acne cleared up completely and if I ever did get pimples it was always around the same time in the same spot. My periods were 3-5 days and they were very light with little to no cramps. No condoms with bf and never had a pregnancy scare. I would recommend OrthoTriCyclenLo.</div>
