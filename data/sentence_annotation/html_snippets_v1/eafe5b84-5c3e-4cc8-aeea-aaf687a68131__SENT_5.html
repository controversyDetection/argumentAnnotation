<div class="entities" style="line-height: 2.5; direction: ltr">I took this pill for a week. ONE week. In that time I began seriously contimplating my own suicide as well as found myself in the hospital for what I believe to be a full detachment from reality. Since then, I have had multiple seuizures and lost numerous days of memory. I have no definitive proof that the birth control cause all of these issues, but I believe so strongly that they are connected that I feel I must warn anyone considering trying this pill.
