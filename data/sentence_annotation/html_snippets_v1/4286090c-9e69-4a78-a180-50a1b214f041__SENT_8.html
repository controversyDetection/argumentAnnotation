started taking 150mg Wellbutrin SR about a month ago to treat severe atypical depression, and it has been nothing short of miraculous for me.  The first two weeks were rough.  I had some heart palpitations brought on by a combination of the meds and caffeine, so I had to stop the caffeine.  I also had to work through a bit of insomnia early on, but that side effect has subsided, and now I actually sleep and wake well rested.  For the first time in a decade, I'm hopeful.  My negative thoughts are still there, but unlike before, I have control over them.  I can manage them in a non-destructive way.  Words cannot express what it feels like to know that you can, for the first time in so long you can't remember, function as a normal person.</div>
