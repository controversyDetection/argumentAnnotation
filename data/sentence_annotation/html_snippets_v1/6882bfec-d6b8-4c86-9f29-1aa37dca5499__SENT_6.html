Ladies, at first I was super hesitant but I had to get off the Trinessa birth control because it caused me too much bloating and I was miserable 3 weeks out of the month. I was so excited to get the implant but the reviews I read freaked me out. The process was super easy and fast.

    The most uncomfortable part was the numbing process (it stung a bit).

 I didn't feel the implant insertion at all. There was bruising for about a week and it itched quite a bit but it went away after a week once it was fairly healed. As far as side effects, I felt a bit moody for about 2 weeks and I had a headache for a few days when I first got the implant. I've had ZERO bleeding and NO weight gain.</div>
