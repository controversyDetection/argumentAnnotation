<div class="entities" style="line-height: 2.5; direction: ltr">I have only been on Victoza for less than a week now and already huge difference in my levels. Prior to Victoza I was on 2000mg Metforming, 5mg Onglyza following a low carb diet.

    That brought my levels down to an average of about 14 while fasting.

 Since being on the Victoza the highest reading I have had so far is a 12.5 which for me is incredible I can't wait to see what I will be at over the next month.  I am not focusing on the weight loss at the moment if it happens awesome, but I'm most concerned about my sugars. As for side effects I have had very mild nausea and that's all.</div>
