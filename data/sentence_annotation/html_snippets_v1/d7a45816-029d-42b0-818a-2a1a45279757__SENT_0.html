    I got the implant a bit ago, and have had ZERO negative side effects besides the awesome no more menstrual cycle!

 The reviews of endless spotting, weight gain, and acne have not been true for me at all. I put off getting the implant a long time from fear stemming from bad reviews, so I decided to throw my good experience in the hat for perspective! </br></br>Im one of the 1:3 who it stopped my period quickly after having it put in. The bruise on my arm was there for about a week, and my very mild hormonal acne cleared up about two weeks into having it. Most importantly, it has helped even out my energy throughout the month. </br>I am a 24 year old graduate student with a history of ovarian cysts and adult onset mild acne.</div>
