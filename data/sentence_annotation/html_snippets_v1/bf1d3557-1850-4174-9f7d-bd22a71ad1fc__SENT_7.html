<div class="entities" style="line-height: 2.5; direction: ltr">Okay so I've had pneumonia (Viral) and now I'm left with post viral bacterial bronchitis infection. I've been given Doxycycline (Sandoz) tablets and have only taken six tablets. Now my doctor also notice that I also have quiet severe acne and scaring. He explained about the medicine and said if my skin starts clearing up let him know and I can get more. My experience so far is amazing only reason why it's one off from 10/10 is because I did break out in the first 3 days and it brought up an ugly big pimple that has left me bruised. 3 days later almost gone.

 On top of it I do have a daily routine (sometimes). I take Bio Zinic tablets, deep cleanser (Niva) and Real-U (cream) on affected areas. I clean my face 4 days a week.</div>
