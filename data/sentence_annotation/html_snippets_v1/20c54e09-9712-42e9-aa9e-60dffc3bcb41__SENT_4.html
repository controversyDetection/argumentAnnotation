<div class="entities" style="line-height: 2.5; direction: ltr">I told myself if the pill worked for me I would write a review to settle someone else's worries. I am 19 years old and my boyfriend and I were having unprotected sex, he did not ejaculate in me but I took the pill just in case. A week later me and my boyfriend had sex with a condom and it completely broke and he ejaculated in me while I was ovulating.

    I took the pill twice within two weeks and I freaked out until I got my period.

 I wasn't eating or sleeping or doing well in college, then my period came right on schedule. To any girls reading this who are losing their mind, relax. The pill was created and works for a reason.</div>
