<div class="entities" style="line-height: 2.5; direction: ltr">I LOVE THIS! I have been on 2 other types of birth control before Loestrin and they both made me a crazy person! I don't have any mood swings and haven't gained any weight, in fact I've lost weight! The only negative thing I have to say is I'm pretty sure that it made my breasts bigger, but hubby isn't complaining.

    It can be pricey if you don't have insurance, but for me its worth it because I have zero side effects.

 The first month I had spotting and now I get my period every month, its very light, and lasts 2-3 days. Its best to remember that every birth control is different for each individual. I was skeptical about trying Loestrin 24 when I read the reviews, but I tried it anyways and I don't regret it!</div>
