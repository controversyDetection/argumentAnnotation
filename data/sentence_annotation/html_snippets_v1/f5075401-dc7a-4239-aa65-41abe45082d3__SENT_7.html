<div class="entities" style="line-height: 2.5; direction: ltr">I started taking phentermine (adipex) on 3/1/2017, weighing 208 lbs. I'm 28 years old and 5'8. Since having my son 6 years ago, my weight has been up and down dramatically.  When I started the medication it gave me extreme dry mouth but the doctor said that was normal. That helped me increase my water intake. I started carrying a 16 oz water bottle with me everywhere and constantly refilled it.

 I'm not &quot;dieting&quot; per say but it does make me eat smaller portions. I walk my dog 2 miles every day and that's the extent of my excercising. Today is 5/6 and I'm down 18lbs. I highly recommend this pill to anyone who needs a little boost.</div>
