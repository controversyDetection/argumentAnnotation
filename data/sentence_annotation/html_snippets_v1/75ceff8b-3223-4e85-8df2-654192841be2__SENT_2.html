<div class="entities" style="line-height: 2.5; direction: ltr">This is my favorite hypnotic drug. I've been suffering from insomnia for at least ten years, with good stretches and bad ones.

    Through CBT, I've learned to worry less about sleep, but I'm still a light sleeper and would wake up many times during the night, which is a source of anxiety and a burden.

 Taking 25 mg allows me to sleep trough the night with fewer awakenings and less difficulty falling back to sleep. Trazodone is a tool in your arsenal, but it's not &quot;sleep-in-a-pill&quot;: it won't knock you out like the benzos or z-drugs, and that's not a bad thing, because this effect tends to create tolerance and rebound insomnia. Also, allow one week for the effects to stabilize before drawing any conclusion.</div>
