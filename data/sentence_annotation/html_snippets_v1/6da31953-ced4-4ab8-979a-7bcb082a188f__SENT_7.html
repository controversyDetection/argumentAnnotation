<div class="entities" style="line-height: 2.5; direction: ltr">Since I lost my father in 2001  I have felt so depressed and had no will to live and my mother did not believe in medication so I went through my life in the fog of depression and anxiety. I was not able to focus so I barely got by with my grades in school. I was starting to fail out and everything got to be too much so I went to counseling and they suggested that I see a psychiatrist and I did and it was the best decision of my life.

    I got prescribed Bupropion SR and Gabapentin.

 Bupropion helped me tremendously. I was energetic and motivated and I took Gabapentin at night to sleep. Everyone that told me that antidepressants just mask your depression are full of crap!</div>
