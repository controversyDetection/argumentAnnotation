 About this time started having serious panic attacks. I was nervous all the time. Shortly after I was hospitalized for suicide attacks, I felt like something was taking over my body &amp; I had no control. After pleading my case my Nexplanon was taken out January/Feb 2015 and I have been on the road to recovery ever since. I am doing much better today, have control over my body &amp; emotions. DO NOT USE!</div>
