 I tortured my body for 6 days and I couldn't bring myself to swallow another pill on day 7. I was constantly feeling crappy and a few times I did throw up...I've been off bc for over 15 years and I just continue to use condoms! Ps I only started it to regulate my period and I had just finished my period and started that Sunday, I've been off the pill for 3 days after only taking it for 6 days and I'm bleeding again ! So I had a period on august 30th and I'm now on my period again and it's September 12th ! 13 days apart !!! NEVER AGAIN</div>
