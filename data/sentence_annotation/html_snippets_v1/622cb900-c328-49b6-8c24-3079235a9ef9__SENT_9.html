Granted, it did take the edge off of some of my pain short term. The side effects just aren't worth it. </br></br>I was fortunate enough to only suffer mood swings, anger, brain zaps and so on for about a month because I wasn't on it that long.</br></br>They don't tell you that once you start taking Cymbalta, it's near impossible for someone to safely come off on their own if they have been on it more than a couple of months. </br></br>
