<div class="entities" style="line-height: 2.5; direction: ltr">I have been on Contrave for a little over a month now and I have lost 7 pounds. Not gonna lie, I almost stopped taking it. The first 2 weeks I had severe stomach pains, each time lasting about 10 minutes, after the end of week 2, the pains stopped. I have no had the urge to drink coffee anymore, used to drink 3 cups a day. I am not eating as much, I used to eat a footlong sandwich from Subway, now I'm lucky if I finish half. This is not a medication for people looking for rapid results.

    I am taking it day by day and so far I am happy with my results.
