<div class="entities" style="line-height: 2.5; direction: ltr">Effectiveness I assume is fine. I had the implant inserted October 2016, but at age 45 I'm not fond of the 2 week cycle/spotting, 1 week of nothing and back on to spotting. I took birth control pills for years and my cycle would run 3-5 days every 28 days like clock work. I didn't have an issue forgetting to take them cause I took them when I took my other meds. My doctor was concerned more about blood pressure/stroke possibilities.  This birth control though is not for me. I was told a few months of bleeding then nothing at all. Its been 7 months and 4 phone calls and I'm beyond frustrated.

    Made an appointment to have it removed next week.
