    I first started birth control around 2004, age 22.

  I tried the Pill, and all it did was make me spot and have periods that lasted for weeks- so I stopped using it. Then I tried the NuvaRing- that worked for about 3 months then the spotting started again.  I then had no birth control until August of 2010.  I wasn't sexually active- so didn't worry about it.  I had been told when I first tried to get the IUD in 2004 that you can't have one unless you've had at least one child, so I gave up.  It was either between Mirena or Paragard-since I have heavy menstrual cycles and cramps and PMS, I chose the Mirena. I had the first one in August of 2010 and my second one in September of 2015.  I have had no bad experience with it- my periods are light</div>
