I tried to self medicate with nicotine and caffeine but the caffeine just added to my anxiety..I was put on 100mg twice a day as needed. I like this med. My anxiety has decreased by at least 30 to 40%. Just after my first dose. I am going to take gabapentin every 8 hours from now on. That should cover me during the day at evening.

    That leaves me with 8 hours of sleep in which I don't need the medication.

 My doc said I can take up to 200mg at a time but I am not sure if I am going to do that. I don't wanna be on such a high dose. Things are slightly better than they were before I took the pill and for now, it's all I need.</div>
