<div class="entities" style="line-height: 2.5; direction: ltr">I've been on lexapro for several years. I have to say for some the initial side effects can be overwhelming, but stick with it because it will help most of us. You can train yourself to overcome the sexual side effects, and weight gain can be controlled through proper exercise and diet. I'm not an active person, but have to remind myself to hit the gym several times a week.

    Doing so will greatly and positively affect your mood as well, so just pretend like you have no choice and GO.
