<div class="entities" style="line-height: 2.5; direction: ltr">I started taking the doxcy (100 mg) once a day for my acne.  I am 29 years old female that had never had acne in my teens until now at this age.  Okay so I began with this pill and for me it got worse before it got better. I took this for a month and a week and I did see improvement till like my 4th week of using it. So then my derm prescribed the same doxcy  (100 mg) but now twice a day which is much better along with tretinoin cream 0.05% every night. This has helped me so much.

 I know it's hard but stressing will only make it worse. Just think that one day it will go away.  Now it's been  25 days with the new prescribed doxcy and finally no more acne.</div>
