 I rarely ever experienced spotting, maybe 2 or 3 times this whole time. Never had a period or pregnancy scare. I am due to have it removed early next year since that will be the 3 year mark.  

As of last week I started noticing brown &quot;old blood&quot; after intercourse, not much. By this point I have noticed more blood during intercourse which is off putting at that moment.  
I'll be scheduling an appointment with my doctor soon.</div>
