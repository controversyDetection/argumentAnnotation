<div class="entities" style="line-height: 2.5; direction: ltr">I've been on birth control for a while now due to horrendous cramps and excessively heavy cycles. And I've always been an anti-kid-having lady so hey it works for me. So I ended up switching from the nuva ring (which I loved) to the Mirena. I'm not going to complain about pain because we're all different and to be honest, it really wasn't terrible, a little discomfort. But I've had my Mirena for a little over 2 years now and I've gained 40-50 pounds with no change in diet, I have absolutely no energy for anything (I work and go to school full time), and I'm recently married with no sex drive. At first the Mirena was a God send, no period, no pill, no hassle or worries.

    But now I'm counting down the days this evil thing is gone.
