<div class="entities" style="line-height: 2.5; direction: ltr">I absolutely LOVE this birth control. After having one baby, and always forgetting the pill, I decided I needed to get on something that I didn't have to remember everyday. I didn't want an IUD, because I didn't feel like getting anything inside.

    I decided to get this.

 Boy am I happy! I haven't had any weight gain, no unusual mood swings, and the best periods I've ever had in my life! Barely anything, I don't even have to use tampons. I understand all women are different, but I advise someone that's looking for simplicity, and maybe someone that is very forgetful, to try this out. Insertion is virtually painless, might as well give it a try.</div>
