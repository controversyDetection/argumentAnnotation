<div class="entities" style="line-height: 2.5; direction: ltr">I'm 23, no kids. Had Jaydess (Canadian name for Skyla) inserted about 6 weeks ago, and so far so good! I decided I wanted to get off birth control pills because I suspected they were causing depression and anxiety (they were!).

    The insertion was really painful, but I later learned my uterus was &quot;8/10 on the difficulty scale&quot;, so I'll accept that.

 I had light spotting/bleeding almost every day, for 5 weeks, but it stopped completely last week. The bleeding was 90% less than what I'm used to for my period. I had my checkup today and everything looks good! </br></br>My verdict is if the pill isn't bothering you, it's probably not worth the pain and money. But if you're like me, and have had issues, I highly recommend trying Skyla/Jaydess.</div>
