<div class="entities" style="line-height: 2.5; direction: ltr">I had Kyleena inserted yesterday and I can honestly say that I have never been through anything more painful in my entire life. I have been on the depo shot for a year now so I have not had my period for over a year, meaning my cervix was almost sealed shut. When the IUD was placed, it was moderately uncomfortable with severe pain every few seconds but the worst was yet to come. I was not informed to pre medicate with pain reliever before hand

    so I felt the brute force of the pain.

</mark>
 I had to lay down with a heating pad for 15 minutes before I could even get dressed. Although the doctor said that it wasn't necessary to have someone drive you home, I highly recommend it. I passed out 5 times on the way home from the pain. Pray for my cervix.</div>
