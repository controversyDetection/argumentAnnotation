 I gained about 20 pounds, became anxious about everything, moods began to change, also had severe pain in my ovaries. I got an ultrasound to make sure there weren't any cysts and everything was normal but I continued to have severe pain. Finally, I decided to get it removed and everyting has been good so far no more pain, moods are better, and I've lost weight.</div>
