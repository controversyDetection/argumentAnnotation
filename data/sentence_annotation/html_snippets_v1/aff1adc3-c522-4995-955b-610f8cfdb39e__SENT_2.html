 But I have noticed about 3 days after starting the 120mg a day my psoriasis flared up very bad. I have not added anything new to my diet. The only different was the increase of the Cymbalta. I will keep on taking the medication at that dose. I will just keep on using a lot of creams to help with the Psoriasis rash. I must also say I have been losing a lot of Weight which is a good thing.</div>
