<div class="entities" style="line-height: 2.5; direction: ltr">I am naturally an anxious person/born worrier but I saw a dr because panic attacks were waking me in the night and my chest pain was hard to cope with. I explained to the dr that I didn't feel depressed but I worried constantly through the night about things, and would also wake suddenly with chest pain. The dr sent me for ECG but I knew the pain was linked to anxiety. Anyway, after the ECG came back clear, he prescribed Pregabalin (a much lower dose than most people on here) and I only take one at night. I now sleep better, I have not woken with a panic attack since taking them, and my anxiety is no longer controlling me.
