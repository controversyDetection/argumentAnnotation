    I approached my psychiatrist who told me he'd never heard of this off-label use for Tramadol and he would not prescribe.

    I went back to my former (beloved) psychiatrist who'd stopped accepting insurance (hence the change).

    He was sympathetic, but said he couldn't prescribe it, risking his license.

    I was sure she'd say no, so I never asked until last Friday over the patient portal.

    Now I am torn about visiting her and requesting more.
