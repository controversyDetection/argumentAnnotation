<div class="entities" style="line-height: 2.5; direction: ltr">For years I had battled with IBS D, until being prescribed Effexor XR. I did have problems when changed to the generic. If I missed a dose of the name brand I could take the next dose. On the generic if I missed I would have awful withdrawals.</br>And one manufacturer Zydus 120 mg lasted only 12 hours.</br>I found manufacturer Greenstone will last the 24 hours. My current pharmacy makes sure they have it available, but some pharmacys aren't able to get certain manufacturers.</br>

    I have been able to live a normal life with the medication Effexor XR or generic by Greenstone.

 I do not have IBS D, nor the stress and anxiety of never knowing when it would hit. I am very thankful.</div>
