    This pill makes me feel fatigued the whole time just like the worst I feel before getting my period.

 My energy level has decreased significantly. Secondly I noticed my sex drive is gone. Last but not the least my hair is falling a lot. Initially I was going to give it another month to see if the side effects will get better but now I decide to get off this pill after the first pack. It changed how my body feels completely and I can't be this tired everyday.</div>
