<div class="entities" style="line-height: 2.5; direction: ltr">I have only been on this med for two and a half weeks and have already lost eight pounds!  Before I started taking Contrave, losing weight was an impossibility.  I am on meds that make me gain weight and I tend to binge eat.  I am now making healthy choices and my portions are half of what they used to be and I feel full.  Sometimes I notice a bad side effect.

    But the overall effect of this medication has been great!

I have less depression and more motivation.  Even my light workouts are better.  I feel so pumped to see what the course of treatment brings!  Losing weight for me is priceless.  I have fatty liver disease, high blood pressure and a back injury.  All would be a lot better if I lost weight.  So far so good!</div>
