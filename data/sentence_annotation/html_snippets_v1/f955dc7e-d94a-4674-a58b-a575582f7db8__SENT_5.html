<div class="entities" style="line-height: 2.5; direction: ltr">I have been using the Nuvaring for a few months now. In this time I lost my virginity and it was extremely painful and I had no sex drive. I figured the pain was just from the first time but the pain continued every time I had intercourse and I rarely even wanted to have sex; because it hurt and I had no sex drive. My boobs have grown a size and I have gained approximately 10 pounds. I thought there was something wrong with my body and the low sex drive was a symptom of depression.

    After reading the reviews I feel so relieved to know there's nothing wrong with me.

 I've decided to switch birth controls, however other than those side effects, the nuvaring has kept me from getting pregnant and regulated my period</div>
