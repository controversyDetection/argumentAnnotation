 To sum it up, my bf and I had unprotected sex on Feb 15 but he pulled out and since I forgot bout precum (he claims he doesn't have any) I needed to take the precaution, taking Plan B. He bought the pill and I took it approx 22 hrs after. I had little to no symptoms, first day I had little fatigue and my appetite increased. After so much research, turns out, if you're that 5% of which it doesn't work on its either because you took it too late or have already taken it before so your body is regulating the pill (that's from what I read) I'm a senior in high school and have a lot of plans for my future. My period came today so being a mother is not on the list!!!</div>
