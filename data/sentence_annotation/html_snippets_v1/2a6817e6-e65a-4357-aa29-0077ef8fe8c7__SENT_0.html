 After almost 10 years of being on the pill, my doctor and I decided it was time for some thing different. Insertion was very painful, the first one we were trying was faulty so I had to purchase another one right after to be placed. It was extremely uncomfortable, even after being advised to take 800mg of Motrin! I had my boyfriend bring me to and from the doctor, which I would recommend. After I got home I placed a heating pad on my lower abdomen and slept for about 2 hrs! After I woke up I felt like a completely different person! I had no aches or pains, back to normal! I would highly recommend this to any woman, there's no more remembering! I love it!</div>
