 I've gained 10 lbs out of no where. I'm only 22 and have a fast metabolism. I thought it started to slow down but it didn't make sense. My breasts got smaller, I have lost complete sex drive, my breasts aren't sensitive anymore at all like they used to be and I'm so emotional, even crying at times. The only thing I can say is that it is 100% effective but not worth what it has done to my body. Not only that but I started breaking out on my body and on my face as well.</div>
