    I had been suffering with anxiety for a better part of my life, but never had it gotten as bad as it was in the last 2 years.

 I would have intense panic attacks and was afraid to socialize. This in turn led me to become depressed. The first drug I was put on was fluoxetine. This drug was not compatible with me AT ALL. My anxiety become 10 times worst. I would wake up in the middle of the night and have hour long panic attacks, could barely eat. I genuinely thought I was going to die on this drug, and I even become suicidal. I told my psychiatrist and was put on sertraline 50mg. Within the first week I could feel a significant difference. Way happier, anxiety decreased significantly, and more motivated. I began to felt like my self again!!</div>
