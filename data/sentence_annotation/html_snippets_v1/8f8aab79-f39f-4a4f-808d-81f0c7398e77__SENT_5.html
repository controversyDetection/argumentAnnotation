<div class="entities" style="line-height: 2.5; direction: ltr">I chose to change from Yaz to Nexplanon, because I wanted something new and easy.  I had normal cycles until I started the implant. I bled for 30  days then stop for about a week. My ovaries hurt, my breasts hurt, I have gained about 15 pounds in 2 months, constant headaches and absolutely no sex drive, even cuddling and knowing what he wants next is dreadful.

    Do not get it.
