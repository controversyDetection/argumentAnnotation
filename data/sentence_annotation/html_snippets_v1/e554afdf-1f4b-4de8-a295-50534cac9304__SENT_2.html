    The 1st 3 days was extreme nausea and I would throw up just smelling food.

 After that I could eat by bites only  (one here, one there). The cycle seems to repeat each week as I up the dosage (.6, 1.2 and now starting on 1.8).  I'm just starting on week 3 and am down 17 lbs.  I still can't decide if it's better to be fat and happy than skinny and sick all the time. *shrugs*</div>
