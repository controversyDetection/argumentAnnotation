After many months on the drug I was eventually taking 400mg a day, and having manic thoughts &amp; episodes.  My psychiatrist decided I was bi-polar and then started me on seroquel (rather than give me a break for my nervous system to re-adjust to it's natural state), which I also ended up taking for about 6 months and at about the same dose.  In retrospect I wish I hadn't taken either fluoxetine(Prozac) or seroquel(Quetiapine).</div>
