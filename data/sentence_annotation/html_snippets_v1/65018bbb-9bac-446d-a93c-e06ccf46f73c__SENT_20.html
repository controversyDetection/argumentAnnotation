<div class="entities" style="line-height: 2.5; direction: ltr">This is day three for me taking Contrave.  I was really excited to start the med because I knew it was closely related to Wellbutrin.  Years ago I took Wellbutrin to stop smoking and it work great.  So day 1 I weighed 197lb and I'm 5-3.  Felt kind of fuzzy and in the later afternoon a bit nauseous.  Day 2 after sleeping great woke up and took morning med and shortly later felt nauseous but not bad enough to quit.  Absolutely no appetite, had cereal and beef stick for lunch.  Evening dinner was a half of a small steak and green beans.  Woke up with stomach cramps and diarrhea, had 3 bouts.  I attribute it to the high fatty foods I ate.  Weigh in again on the 4/24/17.   Dr. gave me free month supply
