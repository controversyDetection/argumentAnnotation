<div class="entities" style="line-height: 2.5; direction: ltr">I am a 54 year old woman who started Contrave as a last ditch effort to loose weight before choosing surgery. I found loosing weight while experiencing menopause impossible. When I started the medication, I weighed 213. and I am 5' 2&quot;. I have lost 60 pounds in 16 months. I have had very few side effects. The medication gave me the tool I needed to change my eating lifestyle.  My high blood pressure is resolved and my blood sugars are now normal. I highly recommend this medication. If you are looking for a fast solution, this is not for you.

    Although I do not discourage exercise, I would like to mention that I am not in any kind of exercise program.

 I've gone from a size 18, to a size 10. I am grateful to my Dr. For prescribing this med.</div>
