<div class="entities" style="line-height: 2.5; direction: ltr">The only warning my gyno gave me was that I would be spotting for about 15 days after having the IUD inserted, which was a damn lie.  I spotted for a whole four weeks after the procedure.  My uterus chilled for two weeks before I started spotting again.  I then became frustrated because this irregular spotting was now interfering with my sex life.

    Panty liners, something I never sought to buy, will become your most prized possession.

  During the first 3! months, your period will be irregular.  Mine became lighter but the duration lasted longer.  I went from a 5-day cycle to a 10- 13-day cycle.</div>
