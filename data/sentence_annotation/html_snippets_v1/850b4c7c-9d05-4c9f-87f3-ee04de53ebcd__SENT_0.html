 No birth control method is. However, I enjoy being on it. What I like about Depo Provera is that it's a shot I have to get every 3 months - it's GREAT not having to worry about birth control in-between shots. I don't have to swallow or insert anything or worry about not taking it on time.  For me, it also stops periods which is the number 2 reason I love it, the number 1 reason being that it's very effective at preventing pregnancy.  

I got my first Depo Provera shot when I was 14 to stop periods.  I kept bleeding and spotting and was told that would eventually go away by the 2'nd or 3'rd shot.  That didn't bother me.  </div>
