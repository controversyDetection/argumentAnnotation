<div class="entities" style="line-height: 2.5; direction: ltr">I have OCD, anxiety, and ADHD. I also pick my cuticles everyday. The official name is Dermatillomania and it's closely related to pulling hair out. I've been picking my cuticles for 25 years. There has never been a time when I did not pick them to some degree. I try to hide them and I frequently make them bleed. I take 450 mg of Wellbutrin XL and 25 mg of Paxil (by cutting the pills) daily. </br>I started the Paxil almost a month ago for anxiety.

    While it has helped a lot with anxiety, it's even more incredible to me that my cuticles are now almost perfect with just one tiny blemish and my nails are long.

 This is the ONLY time they've looked like this since I started when I was 9 years old. Very, very pleased! No more hiding my fingers!</div>
