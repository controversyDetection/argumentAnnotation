<div class="entities" style="line-height: 2.5; direction: ltr">I've just hit the 1 year mark on taking this and I have to say it's been a positive experience. Before taking this I hadn't had a period for over 10 months. During my first month, on the exact day it was supposed to start, I finally got my period. Since then, my periods have only gotten lighter and lighter. Now I spot for 1 maybe 2 days a month on the white/brown colored pills. The only other times I spot are if I'm careless about taking it at the same time every day. I have noticed a decrease in migraines (I didn't get them that often, but still), slight increase in breast size, no weight change, and not really any change in acne.

    The only downside is that I'm a little more emotional about silly things I wouldn't normally be.
