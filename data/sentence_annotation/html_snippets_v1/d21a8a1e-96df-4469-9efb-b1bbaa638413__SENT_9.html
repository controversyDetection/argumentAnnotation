<div class="entities" style="line-height: 2.5; direction: ltr">First of all, I started taking birth control when I was 17. I started to regulate and lighten my period. I took Yaz for a year. No problems. After I turned 18, my insurance dropped me so I went to a women's clinic and was given six months of the Ortho. I have been taking it for four months now, and once this pack is gone, I'm done. The side effects are HORRIBLE. I have no drive for sex. I'm moody, I cry constantly.

    My period is heavy and unpredictable.

 It also lasts forever. I haven't gotten pregnant (we use condoms as well though), but that's the only plus. My relationship is at stake here because of a pill.</div>
