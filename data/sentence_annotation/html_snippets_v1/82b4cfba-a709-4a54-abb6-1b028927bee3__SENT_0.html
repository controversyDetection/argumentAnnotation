 but I can seriously notice a difference. I am 21 and for about 6 years (after a traumatic event) I have been suffering from &quot;severe depression&quot;. I have always had pain and always been to tired to do anything but lay in bed and cry! I can now say I am happy! Finally happy, I can't remember a time I was ever like this. I am motivated, active, and enjoying life. It works quick. I do however have mild headaches everyday and multiple nightmares every night. I am told these will subside. It's pricey but I really think its worth it! Good luck to everyone.</div>
