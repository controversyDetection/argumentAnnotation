 When I started the Nuvaring I felt it inside my body and had a lot of cramps. A few days later I started experiencing more cramps and very strong upper stomach pain. They were so bad I missed work for a week. Finally I ended up going to the ER and they couldn't figure out what was wrong. I finally asked the doctor and it was the Nuvaring side effects.</div>
