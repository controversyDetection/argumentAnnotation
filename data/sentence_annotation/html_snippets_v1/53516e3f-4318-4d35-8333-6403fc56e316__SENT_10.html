<div class="entities" style="line-height: 2.5; direction: ltr">have had nexplanon since 12/11/12. It was fine for awhile, until my boyfriend started complaining that we never have sex anymore. Then I realized that we really didn't. I have always been a tad moody, and already had depression issues. Nexplanon made them worse. The worst thing of all was that unfortunately my boyfriend started becoming extremely jealous thinking i was having sex with someone else. I couldn't figure out what happened to my sexual appetite for the longest time. Then it dawned on me, it had to be the implant. i didnt have much of a  problem with implanon, just moodiness. I can honestly say if i were not in a relationship, it would probably be great, but starting nexplanon ruined my relationship, and my selfesteem.
