I was feeling faint &amp; dizzy and definitely not in the mood for anything. I tortured my body for 6 days and I couldn't bring myself to swallow another pill on day 7. I was constantly feeling crappy and a few times I did throw up...I've been off bc for over 15 years and I just continue to use condoms
