<div class="entities" style="line-height: 2.5; direction: ltr">Late 20s, no children. Worked great as far as birth control. Sklya insertion was extremely painful. I spotted on and off for about a month. My period decreased however my cramps increased times 10. It has been 5 months and I was in a lot of pain. I previously would only have cramps on the day my cycle started but now it was the entire week leading up to it. I gave it till this long thinking my body would adjust. Just went to the doctor and she stated that it was still placed correctly but it was not as high up as it should be. I decided to have it removed. I felt an immediate relief! As if my body did not want that thing in there.
