 and it was over. Stopped having a period after three months, and the weird cramps I kept feeling stopped around 5 months. Everything was great until I noticed my clothes weren't fitting anymore. I've gained 10 - 12 pounds despite months of a very clean diet, counting calories, and frequent exercise. I also started losing my hair a few weeks ago, and began sprouting chin hair that I didn't have before, which is making me feel very depressed. I am beyond frustrated and am having it removed in a few days.</div>
