<div class="entities" style="line-height: 2.5; direction: ltr">Started taking Saxenda on April 18th and have had only a few side effects. I have some nausea and a headache in the evenings. I'm hoping this subsides the longer I've been on it. I have lost 6 lbs which is an amazing accomplishment for me. I have not been able to loose more than 2 lbs no matter what diet I've tried. I get full very fast, only eating about 1/2 what I used to eat at each meal. Sleeping great but am experiencing a great deal of fatigue especially late afternoon and evening. Will continue on and hope this weight loss continues. The doctor gave me a month of samples

    so I didn't waste money if it didn't agree with me.
