 I do not have this problem with Mirena. It has not affected my skin (although I currently use medication for acne I've had for years).  I like it because after it's inserted, I can forget about it for a few years.  The only thing I've found inconvenient, is having a partner be able to feel the strings.  BUT my gyno said most men are not even aware.  </div>
