 I now take 1mg 4x a day just to cope with the daily anxiety and it helps me to feel normal in a un normal world. Unfortunately  now my new med doc wants to start weaning me off, which has caused me more anxiety. I feel don't fix whats not broken. But I was told at my age it could cause me to start falling down or lose my balance and become forgetful, really please those things come with age anyway, I've never abused my meds, I'm not falling down or forgetting either.</div>
