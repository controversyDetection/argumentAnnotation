<div class="entities" style="line-height: 2.5; direction: ltr">I got nexplanon the first few days of June. At first, I HATED it and almost had it removed. I broke out horribly, had terrible mood swings and still spotted periodically. I gained about 10 pounds and was not happy with how my body was reacting to it. My doctor told me to wait it out and let my body adjust (since I had only had it for less than 2 months) and I am SO glad I waited. My skin is the clearest it's been, I haven't had a period since August, my mood swings have gotten SO much better and my weight gain stopped.

    I am so glad I stuck it out and highly recommend waiting 3-4 months before making a decision to have it removed.
