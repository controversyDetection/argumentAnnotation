<div class="entities" style="line-height: 2.5; direction: ltr">I've been on Jolessa for 6 months.  I decided to try this because I get bad headaches during my period (even though they'd only last 3 days, 4 days at most) and I wanted to avoid it altogether.  The first two months, it was great.  Then my period arrived a month early and the bleeding lasted for 25 days, mostly light.  I had already picked up my next 90 day pack so I figured I'd try to get through that

    and if I still had the bleeding, I'd talk to my doctor about another birth control.

No need to do that because Jolessa is now working perfectly for me.  It's been wonderful not having a period for a few months.  I'd recommend this birth control to anyone.</div>
