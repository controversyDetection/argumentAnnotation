<div class="entities" style="line-height: 2.5; direction: ltr">I got this implant hoping it would be the best decision of my life. Instead, I think this is the most miserable I've ever been. I've been spotting for an entire month, and it looks like it's not stopping anytime soon. I called the doctor 2 weeks into the spotting, and they told me if it continued to call them the next week. I called them the next week, they brought me in to test for anemia. They find out I don't have it, and the doctor tells me they want me to wait until the 3 month adjustment period is over (May 25) before they decide to give me medication. I get more and more frustrated everyday.

    I don't know if it's worth waiting till May so I can get medication or if I should just get it out soon and be done with this.
